= WordPress Plugin Notes

Minimal Requirements:
1. Update functions to use unique names or prefixes
2. 
3. 

Standard Plugin Features:
1. Create the sym link via a plugin admin page. This is also needed to avoid backup mess.
2. Use classes to protect against function name contention with other plugins
3. Create the action hook for http://*/gallery to render the content in center container.

Next steps:
1. Sample hierarchy, pics included?
2. Make thumb caching either optional or the cache directories' location configurable.
3. Investigate security options, risks
4. Wrap functions in a class
5. Set debug = true and test everything
